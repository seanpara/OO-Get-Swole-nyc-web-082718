# DO YOU EVEN LIFT!?

Word has just come from the higher-ups, and you're in charge of building out a domain that keeps track of weightlifters and the gyms they lift at.  Yes gyms. Everyone knows you need a weekday gym and a weekend gym. And one for when you're traveling, and one that you go to just to show off.  Oh, and that one with a really great steam room.  Gotta love the steam room.

## Deliverables

Here's what we need to be able to do.
